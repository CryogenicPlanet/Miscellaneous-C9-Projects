python3 Summarizer.py Imagine learning for the first 18 years of your life that the Earth is flat all through Elementary School in high-school you grow up hearing about the Flat Earth. We live on and doing boring Flat Earth physics homework and then if you're lucky enough to get to college and psych for the first time, they show you a globe and say sorry for lying the Earth is actually round. Well, this is unfortunately exactly what we do with.
 You probably learned that objects attract each other based on their Mass. So you probably grew up thinking that lights can't possibly be affected by gravity because light is mass listen. I know I did well guess what the source of gravity is not smashed its energy and momentum which light certainly has course regular matter does to so not only does lights get bent passing by a star or planet or black hole but light attracts the planet or star or black hole in return to be sure it's only a very very small amount but a small amount is not zero. Anyway, the point is the Newton's law of gravitation is just an approximation good enough to get us to the moon but not perfect general relativity is better speaking of the Moon probably also learned that if a ship is moving to miles per hour relative to a train and that train is moving to miles per hour in the same direction relative to the ground than the ship is moving for miles per hour to miles per hour to miles per hour equals 4 miles per hour right false experiments in special relativity have confirmed velocities. And so the Sheep will in fact be moving very very ever so slightly slower than four.

It's not a very big effect against yours looks pretty flat doesn't it? But the Earth isn't flat if I walk 10000 km away from my cat and you continued on walking 10,000 kilometers more you're not 20,000 km away from I can't you just 12715 km away is the farthest on Earth you can get from anything on Earth is 12750 km the diameter of the earth and similarly when you try to add two velocities together, there's a cosmic speed limit of 300 million meters per second. That is the speed of light. So just because to our eyes the earth looks flat velocities look like they said we had together and lights looks like it doesn't attract gravitationally is that an excuse to mislead ourselves at our children about the true nature of things?
